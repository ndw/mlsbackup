Call me old fashioned. Call me paranoid. Call me anything you'd like,
but don't call me late for dinner, as my father would say.

Storing XML in a database is an absolutely necessary and entirely
practical solution for building high-performance applications. But
from my perspective one of the key benefits of XML is that XML
documents are ordinary text (well, Unicode). You can store them
on an ordinary filesystem and expect them to last indefinitely.

The code in this project supports the ability to backup a MarkLogic
database to a collection of plain text files on the filesystem.
